		<h4>
		An open letter to Mr Geoff Dawkins about the use 
		of false filler text in academic coding projects. </h4>
		
		<p style="margin-bottom:15px;text-indent:0;">
		Dear Mr Dawkins,
		</p>
<p> In the recent project you assigned us for the 
computer science 061 module entitled &#39;Fundamental 
Technologies for the World Wide Web&#39;, it was specified 
that &#39;the text should be your own (you are no allowed 
to simply copy text)&#39;. When asked to clarify this, 
you insisted that we were not allowed to use any sort 
of text that wasn&#39;t original content written 
specifically for the website. 
<p>It was specifically noted that we were not to use the industry 
standard stock filler text known as Lorem Ipsum.</p>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is dummy Latin text that has been used by the 
printing and typesetting industry since the 1500s and has now made 
its way into the web development community. Lorem Ipsum has its 
roots in extracts from a book written by Cicero in around 45BC 
called <em>&#39;The Extremes of Good and Evil&#39;.</em></p>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is used instead of sensible text when show casing 
the design of a website. It is used as it has a relatively normal 
distribution of letters and words while not having any meaning to 
distract from the website itself.</p>
<p>This is the primary reason that I believe we should be able to 
use Lorem Ipsum text for the purpose of academic website construction. 
The content of the website does not serve any purpose, there are 
no marks to be gained for good content, however there does need to 
be some form of content in order to showcase the effects that we 
have chosen to implement though the use of HTML and cascading style 
sheets. Due to not being able to use Lorem Ipsum, I have had to 
spend a lot more time writing rubbish content, such as this open 
letter, instead of polishing my code.</p>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is not copyrighted, it is free to use, so it is not 
possible for any potential problems to arise from that. Lorem Ipsum 
text would probably set off the plagiarism alarms however this is 
the only problem that I can think of.</p>
<p>I believe that if you allowed the use of Lorem Ipsum on web 
projects, such as this one, you would allow students to dedicate 
more time to the important parts of the project and you might even 
see a noticeable improvement in the quality of the work as students 
focus shifted from content creation to coding.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Yours Sincerely,</p>
