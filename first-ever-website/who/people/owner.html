<h1>Owner</h1>
<h2>Phil Reynolds</h2>
<p>
Phil claims to have been with the company since 
its very beginnings way back in 1016. No one believes 
this. None of us here at the Classic Theatre quite 
know how he came to own the place but he certainly 
has been here for as long as any of us can remember. 
It is possible that he has owned the Classic Theatre for all 
of its 996 years, but that would just be rather creepy.
</p><p>
Phil does well as the owner leaving most of the 
running of the theatre to his carefully selected 
directors. Most of the staff have their story of how he cherry 
picked them from their old jobs and enticed 
them to work for the Classic Theatre.
