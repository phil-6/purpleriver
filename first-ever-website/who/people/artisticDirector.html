<h1>Artistic Director</h1>
<h2>Natalya Arlovskaya</h2>
<p>
Natalya Arlovskaya was born in Kharkiv. 
She longed to get away and really do 
something with her life. She ended up 
attending the National University of 
Culture and Performing Arts in Kyiv, 
where she graduated from the Faculty of 
Choreography with the distinction of 
Producing and Choreographer. </p><p> She then 
proceeded to work at the Odessa Russian Theatre. 
While there she met a dashing man by the name of 
Edward. They fell in love and married. 
Sadly Edward was unable to get a visa so they had to move here. </p>
