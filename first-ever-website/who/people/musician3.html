<h2>Jeff Edwards</h2>
<p>
Jeff Horatio Winston Edwards was born in Edinburgh 
to strict Roman Catholic parents, who dreamed their son would one day 
joining the clergy. However one fatefully cold 
December evening whilst bringing soup and blankets 
to the local homeless, Jeff met an old drunk busker 
who asked Jeff to hold his guitar while he ate, 
the man died eating that bowl of minestrone.Jeff 
was left holding that guitar, which he took as a sign that he was 
destined to be a musician. Jeff has extensive 
experience in the industry, being part of the 
house band for 'Strictly' and has 
recently returned to us from touring with 1D. He is ordained 
to perform Weddings, Christenings and Exorcisms.
