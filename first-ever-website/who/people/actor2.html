<h1>Actor</h1>
<h2>Victoria Bragg</h2>
<p>
 Baroness Bragg has been in the theatre for many years. 
 Eventually the staff stopped trying to make her leave 
 after a particularly lascivious presentation of 
 Macbeth on Stilts and gave her a job.</p><p>She has made her
 career as a critic, stage-hand and all star classical 
 Vuvuzela artist.</p><p>She currently resides in the 2nd floor 
 broom cupboard where visitors will often hear a haunting 
 medley of this august pensioners bodily functions echo 
 softly through the halls
