<h1>Chief Usher</h1>
<h2>Sophia Beckett</h2>
<p>
Sophia's natural talent took her far and wide. When they 
met Phil they were working on a piece for 
Andrew Lloyd Webber. Phil and Sophia became firm 
friends, and started working on small projects 
together. This is where the trouble started as, 
naturally, the high level of contact between Sophia 
and Phil caused Sophia to become quite ill. 
Sophia begged Lloyd Webber to give them time off, 
however Andrew Lloyd Webber turned ugly. </p><p>
Ever since Sophia has been happily working for The 
Classic Theatre, despite the debilitation that 
working with such company causes. Sophia is an 
excellent example of the tenacity that is necessary 
for all of our employees.
