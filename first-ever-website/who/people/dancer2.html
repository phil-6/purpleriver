<h1>Dancer</h1>
<h2>Kate Martasyrko</h2>
<p>
Kate started her career in politics, 
and through her lack of wit, charm 
and common sense, quickly became the 
MP for their local constituency. The 
initial high approval ratings however 
went to Kateâ€™s head and their introduction 
of the vodka tax, legalization of 
Polio and giving away free Imodium 
on the NHS soon lost Kate her job. </p><p>
This is where Kate first contacted 
The Classic Theatre, the same characteristics 
that won her election made her feel 
right at home with The Classic Theatre. </p><p>
Of course the reversal of the free 
Imodium law means that she has to 
work at half wages.
