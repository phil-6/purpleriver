<h1>Actor</h1>
<h2>Rodrigo Guirao Diaz</h2>
<p>
Rodrigo Guirao Diaz, serial extra and 
veteran of no fewer than four Spanish 
language soap operas, majored in theatre 
at the University of Texas. While he 
gained some small recognition amongst 
dedicated Latin American soap fans, Diaz 
has not yet attained a speaking role 
in any mainstream Hollywood production. 
A dedicated career man, Diaz sees himself 
as in for the long haul, maintaining a 
careful diction he hopes will eventually 
find him a role in a high-budget cable drama. 
<!--He supplements his income tending bar at an LA nightclub.--> </p><p>
He is currently engaged in writing a 
theatrical retelling of El Cid Conquistador, 
which he will of course direct and star in.
