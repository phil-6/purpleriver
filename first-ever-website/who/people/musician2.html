<h1>Musician</h1>
<h2>Lauren Logan</h2>
<p>
Lauren Logan is a Canadian cellist and classical 
violinist working as a respected session musician. 
Across her twelve year career, Lauren has worked 
with hundreds of signed bands, independent solo 
acts and everything in between, contributing to 
nineteen top 100 albums, and five feature length 
film soundtracks.</p><p> In this time, however, she has 
produced only two EPs of her own, solo work to 
modest acclaim and lukewarm public reception. 
In the run up to her first full length album, 
she has begun a truncated 'world' tour to promote 
her solo work.
