<h1>Actor</h1>
<h2>Marquis Vinsby</h2>
<p>
A natural Showman, A great talent and extremely 
humble these are all words that have <em>never</em> 
been used to describe Marquis Vinsby. A truly 
terrible actor whose egocentric views influence 
the work he is in. For example he is the first 
known actor to be killed by popular demand in a 
pantomime. He was Peter Pan. 
</p><p>
To be honest if hadn't contributed financially to 
the last four refurbishments we would not even 
have him. However he does have some great 
characteristics; we aren't sure what they are but 
we will find them one day. We really hope so...
