<h1>Head of Sales</h1>
<h2>Dominika Eliska Skodna</h2>
<p>
Dominika Eliska Skodna came to us after THAT 
appearance on the apprentice.  Yes, she was 
the bossy know-it-all who contrived to make 
a loss selling sweets to fat kids. However in 
fairness there is no denying a real talent 
selling a large amount of tickets to gullible 
American tourist companies. </p><p> Prior to 
the Apprentice she worked at Bear Stearns & 
Northern Rock at the accounts side before 
moving on as an Administrator for Portsmouth 
FC responsible for selling assets. An intensely 
private person not much is known outside of 
work except that her husband likes her in Uniform...
