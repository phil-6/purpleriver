<h1>
What We Do
</h1>
<p>The Classic Theatre is all about entertainment. We are here to entertain <em>you</em>, and we can cater to however you like to be entertained. We do specialise in performance events and private functions however if it takes something a bit more exotic to entertain you just contact us and we will get it sorted for you!</p>
<p>Our main stage plays host to a variety of shows, including plays, dances and concerts. All of our forthcoming events can been seen by clicking on the events list on the left.</p>
<p>We have a whole host of functions rooms, click over on the left for more information on those.</p>
<p>We also have a full size cinema screen, currently this is only for our private members. Once you join the Classic Theatre Community we will show whatever movie you would want to see on the big screen at no extra cost. If you would like more information on this or if you would like to join the Classic Theatre Community then please contact us with your query.</p>
<p>Why not have a look at how entertained previous visitors to the Classic Theatre have been by clicking on the link to our reviews page.</p>
<p>Finally a calendar of our events is coming soon.</p>
